# 🌍 IP Address Tracker

## A responsive IP Address Tracker built as part of a Frontend Mentor challenge.
## This application allows users to search for any IP address or domain and view its location details along with a live interactive map.


# 🚀 Overview

## The IP Address Tracker fetches real-time geolocation data and dynamically displays:
##	•	IP Address
##	•	ISP (Internet Service Provider)
##	•	Interactive map with updated coordinates

 ## All functionality was implemented using vanilla JavaScript without any frameworks. 


# 🎯 The Challenge

## This project was built from a design provided by Frontend Mentor to improve:
##	•	API integration skills
##	•	DOM manipulation
##	•	Asynchronous JavaScript (Fetch API)
##	•	Dynamic UI rendering
##	•	Interactive map implementation
##	•	Responsive layout development


# 🛠️ Built With
##	•	HTML5
##	•	CSS3
##	•	Vanilla JavaScript
##	•	Fetch API
##	•	Leaflet.js (for map visualization)
##	•	IP Geolocation API (ipwho.is)


# ⚙️ Features
##	•	Search any valid IP address or domain
##	•	Real-time data fetching
##	•	Dynamic UI updates without page reload
##	•	Interactive map that updates based on IP location
##	•	Error handling for invalid searches
##	•	Fully responsive design


# 🧠 What I Learned
##	•	Working with third-party APIs
##	•	Handling asynchronous operations using async/await
##	•	Updating UI dynamically based on API responses
##	•	Integrating external libraries like Leaflet
##	•	Managing state updates without breaking functionality
##	•	Debugging real-world API behaviors


# 📁 Project Structure

## This project was built entirely inside a single index.html file.

## It includes:
##	•	HTML structure
##	•	CSS styling (inside a <style> tag)
##	•	JavaScript logic (inside a <script> tag)

## All contained in one file for simplicity during development.


# 🌱 Future Improvements
##	•	Add loading state animation
##	•	Improve error UI feedback
##	•	Implement dark mode toggle
##	•	Refactor into separate HTML, CSS, and JS files for scalability


# 🙌 Acknowledgment

## Design challenge provided by Frontend Mentor.
## Logic implementation and customization completed independently.


## If you want, I can also give you:
##	•	A more technical version (for recruiters 👀)
##	•	A shorter GitHub-friendly version
##	•	Or a more confident “tech babe engineer” tone version
